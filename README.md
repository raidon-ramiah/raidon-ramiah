### Hi
  - Iâ€™m currently working on a message board/ forum type of website. This uses authentication and allows people to add/edit/delete their own posts, or comments under posts
  - I'm trying to learn new technologies and deepen my understanding of the tech I'm already familiar with
  - Theres a few projects I'm collaborating with people on, updates coming soon!!!
